 			<p>Chelsea haven't given up hope of signing West Ham United star Declan Rice before the transfer window closes.

The Blues have been heavily linked with a move for the versatile midfielder, who spent his formative years in the club’s academy before being released at 14 years old.

West Ham do not want to lose the England international and have, according to 90mins , placed a £90million price tag on Rice. Yet that has not put off Lampard who has asked the Blues to pay whatever it takes to land the 21-year-old.

The report claims, however, members of the Chelsea hierarchy are not entirely convinced by Rice, who has made more than 100 Premier League appearances for the Irons.</p>

 			<p>The Blues landed Edouard Mendy last week to take their summer spending to around £250million.

The goalkeeper joins Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr, Thiago Silva and Kai Havertz in arriving at Stamford Bridge this summer.

Frank Lampard may not be finished there, either, with West Ham’s Declan Rice another potential target in this window, while a number of players are set to be shipped out to make space in the squad.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Antonio Rudiger, Ross Barkley and multiple others are all being liked with moves away.</p>
